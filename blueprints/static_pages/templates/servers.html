                <p>A server with a custom generated map, dedicated to surviving against the environment and building. Build your dream home or join others to construct cities. PvP is not allowed, build protections are available, and chests can be locked so you can protect what you've worked for.</p>
                <p>Server can be joined directly by connecting to <code>p.junction.at</code>.</p>

Protect your chests so your enemies won't steal it all.</p>

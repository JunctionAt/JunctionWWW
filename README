You need to create a local_config.py file that includes PORT to listen on, ENGINE for a mysql connection string,
and any other configs you want for your test environment:

$ cat <<EOF> local_config.py
> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
> DEBUG = True
> PORT = 9001
> ENGINE = create_engine('mysql://wiggitywhack:wiggitywhack@localhost/wiggitywhack', echo=True)
> EOF


If you want to create all the tables (at least the ones wiggity has added models for):

$ python
>>> import app
>>> from blueprints.base import Base
>>> Base.metadata.create_all()


Launch as a usual flask app:

$ python app.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:9001/
 * Restarting with reloader

You need to create a local_config.py file that includes PORT to listen on, ENGINE for a mysql connection string,
and any other configs you want for your test environment:

cat <<EOF> local_config.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
DEBUG = True
PORT = 9001
ENGINE = create_engine('mysql://wiggitywhack:wiggitywhack@localhost/wiggitywhack', echo=True)
EOF


Launch as a usual flask app:

$ python app.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:9001/
 * Restarting with reloader
